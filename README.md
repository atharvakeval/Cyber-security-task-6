# Cyber-security-task-6
What I Did
In this task, I created several sample passwords and tested their strength using an online password strength checker. 
The aim was to understand how password length, complexity, and randomness impact security.

 Steps I Took
1. Created a list of passwords with varying lengths and complexity.
2. Tested them using a password strength tool.
3. Noted down the results and compared weak vs strong passwords.
4. Learned how to improve weak passwords.

 Learning Outcome
I learned that longer passwords with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols are significantly harder to crack.
